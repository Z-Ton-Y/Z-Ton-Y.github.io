I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Science](https://science.westlake.edu.cn/), [Westlake University](https://westlake.edu.cn/). My research interest includes machine learning, quantum physics and condensed matter physics.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Congjun Wu](https://wucj.lab.westlake.edu.cn/) of Laboratory of Novel States of Matter and Their Organizational Principles from School of Science, Westlake University.
